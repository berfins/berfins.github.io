  <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a scientific discipline that endeavors to enable computers
to learn without the need for explicit programming. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs),
a subset of ML algorithms, mimic Darwinâ€™s Theory of Evolution by using natural
selection mechanisms (i.e., survival of the fittest) to evolve a group of individuals
(i.e., possible solutions to a given problem). Genetic Programming (GP) is the most
recent type of EA and it evolves computer programs (i.e., individuals) to map a set of
input data into known expected outputs. Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming
(GSGP) extends this concept by allowing individuals to evolve and vary in the semantic
space, where the output vectors are located, rather than being constrained by syntaxbased structures. Linear Scaling (LS) is a method that was introduced to facilitate the
task of GP of searching for the best function matching a set of known data. GSGP
and LS have both, independently, shown the ability to outperform standard GP for
symbolic regression. GSGP uses Geometric Semantic Operators (GSOs), different
from the standard ones, without altering the fitness, while LS modifies the fitness
without altering the genetic operators. To the best of our knowledge, there has been
no prior utilization of the combined methodology of GSGP and LS for classification
problems. Furthermore, despite the fact that they have been used together in one
practical regression application, a methodological evaluation of the advantages and
disadvantages of integrating these methods for regression or classification problems
has never been performed. In this dissertation, a study of a system that integrates both
GSGP and LS (GSGP-LS) is presented. The performance of the proposed method, GSGPLS, was tested on six hand-tailored regression benchmarks, nine real-life regression
problems and three real-life classification problems. The obtained results indicate that
GSGP-LS outperforms GSGP in the majority of the cases, confirming the expected
benefit of this integration. However, for some particularly hard regression datasets,
GSGP-LS overfits training data, being outperformed by GSGP on unseen data. This
contradicts the idea that LS is always beneficial for GP, warning the practitioners about
its risk of overfitting in some specific cases.<p>
